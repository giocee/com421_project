        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p><strong>Q: What counts as yard waste?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yard waste is organic material produced from maintenance of lawns and gardens such as grass clippings, leaves, weeds, flowers, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Can I mix compostable food garbage with my yard waste?</strong></p>
        <p>A: No, yard waste will only be collected if it consists solely of organic materials produced from yard maintenance.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Where can I get Stick it to the Can stickers?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Stick it to the Can stickers are available at your local post office, library, police station, and most community centers. They are also purchasable at participating retailers (information forthcoming). They are planned to be orderable from this website in the future.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Can I only apply Stick it to the Can stickers to plastic garbage bags?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Stick it to the Can stickers can be applied to any receptacle of practical waste management use (especially cans!) as long as the sole material contained within is yard waste.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: How long can I expect to wait before my yard waste is collected after pick up is requested?</strong></p>
        <p>A: It depends on the volume of requests in your area, but the wait is expected to be within 1 week and no more than 3.</p>
