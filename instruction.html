        <h2>Other Home Disposal Methods</h2>
            <p>
                An alternative way to dispose yard waste at home is to compost. Composting consist of three ingredients:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Greens</li>
                <li>Browns</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The greens (grass clippings, fruit scraps, vegetable waste and coffee grounds) provide carbon for the compost. The browns (tree branches, twigs, and dead leaves). The water is meant to help moisten the compost. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Composting can be done in the backyard or at home if there is no space in the backyard.
            </p>
                <h3>Steps to Composting in the Backyard/Home</h3>
                <div id="compoststeps">
                <ol>
                    <li>Find a dry and shady spot for the compost bin in the backyard or at home</li>
                    <li>Take the browns and dump it into the bin</li>
                    <li>Take the greens and dump it on top of the browns.</li>
                    <li>Occasionally add water to moisten the compost. Add water only until the material looks moist and not overflowed with water.</li>
                    <li>Take a lid and cover the bin to prevent the compost from being watered by the rain.</li>
                    <li>Every 3 weeks take a shovel or pitchfork to mix the materials in the composting bin.<sup>1</sup></li> 
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> A healthy compost should have more carbon than nitrogen so use ⅓ green and ⅔ browns when making the compost. 
		 This compost usually takes between 2 to 5 weeks.<sup>2</sup>
