        <h>Project Summary</h>
        <p>
            Stick it to the Can is a project designed by a group of four Illinois Institute of Technology students. We discovered that yard waste is causing an environmental problem because people are not properly disposing their yard waste. Yard waste takes up valuable landfill space because they are highly reusable and compostable. This space in the landfill can be used up by items that are not reusable. Yard waste also creates dangerous methane emission and acidity when it is broken down. Chicago has a history of not properly disposing yard waste. The residents of Chicago are not aware of the yard waste disposing system. Yard wastes are thrown into regular trash bins and are then dumped into the landfills. There are some residents who are aware of the yard waste system; however, when they request 311 to pick up the yard waste, the garbage crew takes the yard waste and still dump it into the landfill. There is no way for the garbage crew to differentiate the garbage and yard waste. This will only cause the the yard waste to take up valuable space in Chicago’s landfill and produce more methane in anaerobic conditions.

            Stick it to the Can is specifically designed to target the problem with Chicago’s yard waste system. We have designed a new procedure that will persuade and remind the residents to properly dispose yard waste. It will also prevent the garbage crews from mistaking the yard waste as garbage. We have created a sticker band that will require the Chicago residents to place yard waste in a separate bag and seal it with the sticker band. This sticker has a reminder for the residents to call 311 to request for yard waste pick up. Not only that, but the sticker will help the garbage crew know that the bag is yard waste and not garbage.
