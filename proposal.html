        <h1>Proposal Summary</h1>
          <p>
	    Improper disposal of discarded leaves, branches, and other organic material, also known as yard waste has 
            been found to cause environmental damage. Yard waste is highly compostable and discarding it with other garbage 
            fills up valuable landfill space with reusable material. Yard waste also creates dangerous methane emission and
            acidity when it is left to decompose in landfills. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Currently, Chicago's yard waste disposal program requires residents to dial 311 to request a yard waste pick-up. 
            However, this program is largely unknown to residents. To make matter worse, because most yard waste is placed 
	    into standard black garbage bags, it is commonly mistaken for garbage, rather than compost and taken to landfills
            by mistake. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Stick it to the Can was specifically designed to target the problem with Chicagoâ€™s yard waste system. 
            This new program intends to encourage and remind residents to properly dispose yard waste. It also helps to 
            prevent sanitation crews from mistaking the yard waste as garbage. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
            The Stick it to the Can program revolves around a simple sticker. The sticker, when placed on a bag 
            containing yard waste differentiates while reminds residents to call 311 to request for yard waste pick up 
            either via QR code or phone.
